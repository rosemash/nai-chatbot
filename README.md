# NovelAI Chatbot

This is a web server written in Lua that serves a web chatbot interface for use with NovelAI. It lets you talk to multiple concurrent AI chat partners at once, saving persistent chat memory to disk so you can resume your conversations on any device on your network.

To use NovelAI Chatbot, you will need a NovelAI API token, and will need to update the config file to reflect your NovelAI subscription tier (for access to Krake v2 and higher context and output). Instructions on running NovelAI Chatbot and configuring a key are below.

# Running NovelAI Chatbot

To run NovelAI Chatbot, first clone this repository (or download it as a zip and extract it). NovelAI Chatbot is a Luvit project. Luvit is a standalone distribution of the Lua programming language bundled together with libuv, which enables Lua to do things like host a web server, make calls to NovelAI's REST API, and perform async i/o.

Luvit is very straightforward to install. To use it, you will need to [bootstrap the Luvit runtime](https://luvit.io/install.html), which will leave you with `luvit.exe` (or `luvit` on Linux/MacOS). The instructions below explain how to retrieve the Luvit runtime and run this project with it.

## Windows (Simple)

For Windows users: if you don't know what you are doing, follow these instructions to set up luvit and start the chatbot server:

1.  Navigate to the folder for this repository that you cloned or downloaded, then type `cmd` into the address bar of the file explorer and press enter.

2. In the command prompt that opens, paste the command for Windows users provided on the [installation page for Luvit](https://luvit.io/install.html).

3. Once the installation command finishes, don't close the command prompt. To run NovelAI Chatbot, you should be able to enter the following command into the same prompt: `luvit server.lua`.

Note that upon performing the second step, it should create 3 new files in the folder: `luvit.exe`, `luvi.exe`, and `lit.exe`. You can safely delete `luvi.exe` and `lit.exe` if you want.

Since the second step retrieves the Luvit runtime, you only need to follow it once; once you have it, starting the server only requires repeating the first and third steps.

## Windows/Linux (Advanced)

If you're a more advanced user, you probably already know how to install Luvit using the instructions on the install page. Regardless of your platform, I recommend putting the `luvit` (or `luvit.exe`) and (`lit` or `lit.exe`) binaries in your path; `luvi` (or `luvi.exe`) is used for bootstrapping, and can be deleted.

The dependencies are already included in this repo's [deps](deps) directory (most of them have their licenses appended to the top, and all allow redistribution) but you can easily re-install them like this:

```
$ lit install luvit/secure-socket
$ lit install creationix/coro-http
$ lit install creationix/base64
```

The port that the web server binds on can be changed in the config file. The server should be reachable from both the local loopback address and any other IP address for your device.

# Configuring for your NAI account

You will need to change the config file to add your API token and select the model that reflects your subscription tier before using the chatbot. Open the config in any text editor, then change the following values to reflect your account:

* Change `use_krake = false;` to `use_krake = true;` if you have an Opus subscription and access to Krake v2.

* Set `api_token = "";` by putting your API token into the quotation marks (instructions for that are in [Finding your NAI API Token](#finding-your-nai-api-token)). This is important. The chatbot won't work at all without an API token.

Those are the only important options. The comments in the file provide explanations for what each of the rest of the options do, and you can adjust them as you see fit. When you are finished, save and close the file, and restart the chatbot server (if it's running).

## Model Comparison

NovelAI Chatbot was designed with Krake v2 in mind. It simply has a better understanding of the context; it doesn't need much help to fall into a pattern of coherent chat. Support for using this project without access to Krake was added by having it default to Euterpe. While it's possible that the settings used for Euterpe (defined in [novelai/generate.lua](novelai/generate.lua)) are not perfect, the caveats it introduces could also be just limitations of the model.

Euterpe with this tool in particular has a tendency to send very long messages, and to misinterpret the tone of every conversation as being sexual, or to push the conversation in that direction, even if that's not what you intended. Krake v2, in my experience, doesn't default to that assumption, and all-around comes off more human in the length and nuance of its responses.

If you are using Euterpe, testing suggests you may have to coax Euterpe into behaving as a viable chat partner. It's highly recommened to use the `/remember` command (type `/?` for more info) before sending the initial message to create an initial memory entry describing the bot's personality, e.g.: `/remember Oliver is a man of few words. He speaks using short, simple sentences. He enjoys talking about literature.`.

That seems to mitigate most of Euterpe's shortcomings, and I've been able to get Krake-like results after a few attempts. The trick is to ensure the first few exchanges set a good standard for the AI to continue from. But if what you want is a strong hands-off chatting experience, Krake remains the better option.

# Finding your NAI API token

The chatbot requires a NovelAI API token to make requests on behalf of your account. To get a NovelAI API token, follow these instructions:

1. Login to NovelAI through the website.

2. Create a new story, or open an existing story.

3. Open the Network Tools on your web browser. (For Chrome or Firefox, you do this by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I, then switching to the Network tab.)

4. Generate something. You should see two requests to `api.novelai.net/ai/generate-stream`, which might look something like this:

5. One of these request contains your API token. To find it, select a request, then in the Headers tab of the inspection panel, scroll down to the very bottom. Look for a header called Authorization:  
![Screenshot showing the Authorization header in the Network panel.](https://i.imgur.com/UOJKQK4.png)

The long string (after "Bearer", not including it) is your API token. Copy it for use in [Configuring for your NAI Account](#configuring-for-your-nai-account). There is nothing else you need from here.

## API Token Lifetime & Login Alternative

NovelAI API tokens last a very long time, but they probably eventually expire. If you don't want to repeat this process again in the future, there is a utility script in this repository - [novelai/login.lua](novelai/login.lua) - which can be configured to generate a new API token using your NovelAI login key anytime you need.

The script isn't currently documented, but it should be easy enough to figure out if the above steps were simple to you. I may at some point add a way to login using your NovelAI credentials so none of this is necessary, but due to the cryptographic way NovelAI's login API works, it would require adding even more dependencies to this project.
